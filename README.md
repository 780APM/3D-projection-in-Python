Proejction Exmaple of a 3D rotating cube, projection is simply the manipulation of a 2D object into a 3D object.

Projetion is the process of selecting verticies and projecting them onto a 2D plane. From there you can use a matrix structure using 3 points (x,y,z), these 3 points can build the vertices of the cube from a 2D structure when multiplied by the matrix.
