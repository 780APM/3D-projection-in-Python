# 3D-projection-in-Python
3D projection using python and pygame. This is a way of projecting 3D dimensions with 2D data.

This project is a quick little task i gave myself over the course of a few days to refresh my memory with Python!  I also think that it is a great tool for some visual learning on how people can get into coding. This project covers some really good fundamentals, espically with visualisation of code into an output. 

Proejction Exmaple of a 3D rotating cube, projection is simply the manipulation of a 2D object into a 3D object.

Projetion is the process of selecting verticies and projecting them onto a 2D plane. From there you can use a matrix structure using 3 points (x,y,z), these 3 points can build the vertices of the cube from a 2D structure when multiplied by the matrix.

This projet was based off of a few examples that i found online. Click [here](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/project62.html) to go to the original exmaple i stumbled across. And click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw0oY6Ld-L0&ab_channel=Pythonista_) to view a excellent tutorial on this project!
